# Testing Sidenotes

<!---
Sidenotes{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' 'This is a sidenote and *displays a superscript*'%} display a superscript. The *sidenote* Liquid tag contains two components. The first is an identifier allowing the sidenote to be targeted by the twitchy index fingers of mobile device users so that all the yummy sidenote goodness is revealed when the superscript is tapped. The second components is the actual content of the sidenote. Both of these components should be enclosed in single quotes. Note that we are using the CSS 'counter' trick to automagically keep track of the number sequence on each page or post. On small screens, the sidenotes disappear and when the superscript is clicked, a side note will open below the content, which can then be closed with a similar click. Here is the markup for the sidenote at the beginning of this paragraph{% sidenote 'sn-id-whatever' 'This is a sidenote and *displays a superscript*'%}.
